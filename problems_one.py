"""
Write a function that has two parameters.
The first parameter will be a list of numbers, the second parameter will be a number.
Iterate over the list & compare each value to the number parameter
If it is greater than the number parameter, add it to a new list
Return the new list

Example Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3 
Example Output: [4, 5]

"""
Write a function that has two parameters: a list, and another list
Both lists that are passed in should contain the first names of people
Iterate over the lists comparing the values at each index from one list to the other. 
If there is a matching name in both lists, return that name from the function

Example Input: [“Nevin”, “David”, “Mike”], [“Brett”, “Mike”, “Dan"]
Example Output: "Mike"
