# Problem 1

"""
Write a function that takes in a Tuple of 4 values
This function should unpack the Tuple into 4 variables,
Then create two NEW tuples, with two variable values in each
Finally, create another new Tuple, with the other two Tuples nested inside of it
Return this final nested Tuple

Example Input: (1,2,3,4)
Example Output: ((1,2)(3,4))

"""
Write a function that takes in a Tuple of Batting Averages
Convert to a List, sort highest to lowest, and return the highest value

Example Input: (.123, .301, .290, .313, .106)
Example Output: .313

"""
Write a function that takes in a string
The function should determine if every vowel is present in that string
If so, print "Congratulations, you passed the Vowel Test"
Otherwise print "Wrong! Try another string!"
HINT: A set of all vowels {'a','e','i','o','u'} will be helpful for this task!

Example Input: "Eunoia"
Example Output: "Congratulations, you passed the Vowel Test"

Example Input: "devCodeCamp"
Example Output: "Wrong! Try another string!"

# Problem 4


"""
Write a function that takes in a list of numbers
The function should return a list of tuples,
where the FIRST value is the original number,
and the SECOND is the square of the original number


Example Input: [2,3,4]
Example Output: [(2,4),(3,9),(4,16)]

Example Input: [5,10]
Example Output: [(5,25),(10,100)]

"""
Write a function that takes in a Tuple
Your function should remove the value from the END of the Tuple, and place it in the middle, then return that tuple
HINT: You will need to convert the Tuple to a different data structure to achieve this!

Example Input: (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 2)
Example Output: (1, 3, 5, 2, 7, 9, 1)

"""
Write a function that takes in a list of Tuples
These Tuples will consist of a contact name (string) and a phone number (integer)
Convert this List of Tuples into a Dictionary, where the contact name is the key, and the phone number is the value
Return the dictionary

Example Input: [("Barry Benson", 608123456), ("Bob Belcher", 8088675309), ("Marty McFly", 7198883333), ("Stone Cold Steve Austin", 987654321), ("Jackie Daytona", 3512531122)]
